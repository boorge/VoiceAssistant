# VoiceAssistant

Voice Assistants are software programs that help you ease your day-to-day tasks, such as showing 
weather report, creating reminders, making shopping lists etc. They can take commands via text (online 
chat bots) or by voice. Voice based intelligent assistants need an invoking word or wake word to activate 
the listener, followed by the command. We have so many virtual assistants, such as Apple's Siri, 
Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana.
